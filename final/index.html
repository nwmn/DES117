        <p class="para"> I'm a second year undergraduate living in Northern California. My time is spent between San Francisco and Davis for school. Ultimately, becoming a web experience designer is a major career goal of mine. I am fascinated with software development, product creation, and related industrial processes. Outside of class, I work as a tutor for lower division computer science at the UC Davis Student Academic Success Center in Dutton Hall. On my own time, I enjoy volunteering at the LGBTQIA Resource Center.
